# My Recipe Website
This website features a recipe originally created by my mother.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

When I first started learning HTML and CSS, I was overwhelmed by the number of project ideas I could pursue. Then, it hit me—my mom had shared a delicious recipe with me, and I had written it down in my notes app. Why not use that recipe to create a website and showcase my new skills in HTML and CSS?

That’s exactly what I did! The HTML part of the website came together fairly quickly since I had already researched some sample recipe websites. I knew what elements I wanted to include, like the ingredients and instructions.

The most challenging part was the CSS. There were so many styling options, and I spent weeks experimenting with different colors, text alignments, and layouts. During this time, I also learned about classes and IDs, and how their specificity can help target specific elements effectively. Eventually, the design began to take shape, and the CSS flowed naturally.

## Optimizations
Toward the end of the project, I focused on making the website responsive—ensuring it would look great on any device, from desktop to mobile. I learned how to optimize the design for even the smallest screens, which was a great confidence boost. Knowing that users with different devices could access the site comfortably was a rewarding feeling.

## Lessons Learned:
My journey into web development began with a search for coding bootcamps and resources to learn front-end development. At the time, my knowledge was limited to back-end programming, but I wanted to expand my skills to include front-end technologies.

That’s when I discovered streamer Leon Noel, a software engineer who runs a cohort called '100Devs.' This cohort provides free and practical content that goes beyond coding—networking is a key focus as well. I decided to join the community, which has a large Discord group where aspiring developers can interact, share knowledge, and support each other.

In this Discord community, I connected with hundreds of people—some of whom had been part of 100Devs for years, and others who were just starting out in their learning journey. The support I received was invaluable. The members were always eager to help, whether with coding-related questions or personal challenges. Many of them have become close friends, and they continue to inspire and motivate me.

The biggest lesson I learned from this project, and from the 100Devs community, is the importance of having a supportive network. People have often described me as curious and eager to learn, and I’ve found that being open to help and making it easy for others to assist you is essential. These traits have not only helped me with coding but have also been invaluable in networking and connecting with the right people.
